summary: Google's current generation of U2F tokens, the third generation continues the tradition.
---

Google's Third generation FIDO U2F tokens, branded under their Google Cloud program, are produced by FeiTian -- a custom version of the [FeiTian ePASS NFC](../feitian-epass-nfc/) tokens -- coming in either USB-A or USB-C form factors. Both support NFC. Unlike the first generation, there is no Bluetooth version. Unlike their OEM counterparts, they *only* support U2F.
